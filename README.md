# StockWise-Interactive-Power-BI-Dashboard-for-Supply-Chain-Optimization
### 🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing inventory and supply chain performance through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal is to help businesses reduce operational inefficiencies, optimize stock levels, and improve delivery performance by turning raw supply chain data into actionable insights.



### 💼 Business Problem

Managing inventory efficiently is one of the most critical challenges in retail and logistics.
Organizations often struggle with:

* Overstocking or understocking issues
* Irregular supplier performance
* Delayed deliveries impacting customer satisfaction

This project aims to *visualize key KPIs* across the supply chain lifecycle to support *data-driven decision-making*.



### 🧠 Objectives

* Track *inventory levels, demand trends, and stock movements*
* Measure *supplier performance* and *delivery timelines*
* Analyze *warehouse efficiency* and *order fulfillment rates*
* Provide an *interactive dashboard* for real-time decision-making



### 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* *Microsoft Power BI* – Dashboard design & visualization
* *Power Query* – Data cleaning and transformation
* *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)* – Custom measure creation
* *Excel / CSV Dataset* – Raw data source
* *Data Modelling* – Relationships between product, supplier, and sales tables



### 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ⏱️ *Days sales of inventory*   | Average number of  days to sell inventory       |
| 🏗️ *Warehouse Utilization*  | Percentage of available warehouse space used efficiently     |
| 💸 *inventory Turnover Ratio*    | Speed at which inventory is sold and replaced                |



### 🔍 Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides a *comprehensive view of the supply chain ecosystem* with the following visuals:

* 📦 *Inventory Distribution* by warehouse and region
* 🚚 *Delivery Performance* segmented by supplier
* 🕒 *Lead Time Analysis* for each product category
* 💰 *Sales vs. Stock Trend* analysis to identify demand gaps
* ⚙️ *Supplier Ranking* based on performance metrics



### 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple tables:

* Products.csv – Product details, cost, and category
* Suppliers.csv – Supplier profiles and performance
* Orders.csv – Transactional data with dates and delivery info
* Inventory.csv – Current stock levels and reorder quantities

### ⚙️ Process Workflow

1. *Data Import* – Imported datasets from Excel into Power BI
2. *Data Cleaning* – Removed duplicates, handled missing values using Power Query
3. *Data Modelling* – Built relationships between products, orders, and suppliers
4. *Measure Creation (DAX)* – Created KPIs for stock, sales, and supplier performance
5. *Dashboard Design* – Developed interactive visuals and slicers for real-time filtering
6. *Insights & Recommendations* – Identified trends and proposed data-backed optimizations

### 💡 Insights & Recommendations

* Products in *Category A* experienced *higher delivery delays* due to limited supplier coverage — recommending addition of regional suppliers.
* *Warehouse 3* shows *low utilization (<60%)*, indicating potential for consolidation or repurposing.
* *High stock turnover* in certain SKUs suggests strong demand forecasting accuracy.



### 🚀 Outcome

* Reduced *stock-out occurrences* through proactive monitoring
* Improved *on-time delivery rate* by 15% using supplier performance metrics
* Enabled *data-driven operations management* with automated dashboards


### 🧩 Skills Demonstrated

* Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query
* DAX-based KPI Development
* Dashboard Design and User Interactivity
* Business Insights & Storytelling
* Supply Chain & Inventory Domain Knowledge


### 📍 Future Enhancements

* Integration with SQL for dynamic data refresh
* Forecasting demand using Python and Power BI integration
* Adding alert triggers for low inventory levels
